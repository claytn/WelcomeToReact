# Chapter 1: What & Why
___

## What is React?
React is a front-end Javascript framework for building user interfaces. If you want to learn more about what this means or what goals React is trying to accomplish you can visit the docs [here](https://reactjs.org/).

## Why React?
Writing large scale front-ends is a huge pain to do in plain HTML and JS. React allows us to write modular Javscript code that will generate this HTML for us. This cuts down on development time and greatly increases code reusability.

## First React Project Setup
The best way to get started with your first react project setup is [here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). Spend some time looking through the tutorial, but don't get frustrated if everything doesn't make sense immediately. We will spend the next few chapters gradually understanding the basics of how react works and going through examples as well.
